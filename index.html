                            I joined the company as a junior and spent 5 months
                            helping team members with their tasks, the project's
                            API and evaluating the interns' deliveries. After this

                            of this tool. After 9 months at home, I received a promotion
                            to full level, achieved due to the high volume of deliveries
                            and extra activities carried out.

                            I worked on 5 projects, all with Angular 8+ on the frontend,
                            2 with Spring Boot and 3 with ASP.NET on the backend. The
                            projects with ASP.NET were R&D projects, legacy and prior to
                            my Entering the company, with little material about the scope
                            and limited knowledge about the technology used, I faced this
                            challenge alone. Furthermore, to meet customer demands, there
                            were daily interactions. Barriers were overcome and projects
                            were delivered. The other 3 projects were well-established
                            products with small daily deliveries.
